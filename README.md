## Spring learing 

# What is Spring?
The Spring framework is an open-source Java application framework, which is based on two key principles: dependency injection and Inversion of Control. Spring has the ability to autowire the dependency at run time, which allows the developer to write loosely coupled code.

Spring framework uses metadata in the form of xml file or java annotations to create objects and identifies dependencies, thereby producing a ready-to-use application.
