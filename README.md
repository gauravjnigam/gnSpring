## Spring learing 

# What is Spring?
The Spring framework is an open-source Java application framework, which is based on two key principles: dependency injection and Inversion of Control. Spring has the ability to autowire the dependency at run time, which allows the developer to write loosely coupled code.

Spring framework uses metadata in the form of xml file or java annotations to create objects and identifies dependencies, thereby producing a ready-to-use application.

A typical application has a lot of classes and dependencies
* Tight coupling
* Loose coupling

## Tight coupling 
Tightly coupled code involves creating an instance of the dependency inside the class
 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      public class ClassA {
          DependencyOption1 dependency1 = new DependencyOption1();
          //...
      }
      public class DependencyOption1 {
          //...
      }
      public class DependencyOption2 {
          //...
      }
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 Problems can arise when we want to use a different option for the dependency. Suppose if we ClassA wants to rely on different dependency
 This entails changing the code of ClassA, which would be a disadvantage of using tightly coupled code.
 
 ## Loose coupling 
A better way would be to implement an interface. This will remove the direct instantiation of the DependencyOption, and instead, ask for the type of filter as an argument to the constructor.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      interface DepedencyOption {
          //method definitions
      }
      public class DependencyOption1 implements DepedencyOption {
          //implement interface methods
      }
      public class ClassA {

          DepedencyOption dependency;

          public ClassA(DepedencyOption dependency) {
              this.dependency = dependency;
          }

          //...
      }
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This way ClassA is not dependent on a specific type of dependency and can be used with both a DependencyOption1 and DependencyOption2. The above code snippet is an example of loosely coupled code. Loose coupling has a number of advantages.

The Spring framework take cares of writing the above code on its own. Spring creates objects and populates dependencies. As a programmer, you only have to tell which objects it has to create and what the dependencies of each object are.

*Spring inverts the control by taking responsibility for populating the dependency. This is referred to as Inversion of Control (IoC). Spring is a dependency injection framework that promotes loosely coupled code.
